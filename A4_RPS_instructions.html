    <p>The Element Game is a very simple game that has the same objecive as rock paper scissors: the player chooses an element from your given options. Each element can kill two other elements and get killed by two other elements.</p>
    <h2  class="marginTitle">Your choices:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Fire</li>
        <li>Electricity</li>
        <li>Air</li>
        <li>Earth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2  class="marginTitle">Two Modes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Player</li>
        <p>The one player mode is designed for players to play against an AI generator. The odds are even. Since there are 5 choices the odds of each element being chosen is 20%. Your choice and the generated element will be displated each round. You can choose the score you would like to play to prior to beginning the game. </p>
        <li>2 Player</li>
        <p>The two player mode is designed for those who have a friend with them and prefer to play against them. The game will offer each player a chance to choose an element. For the game to be fair we recommend each player to look away while the choice is being made by the other player. Both of the players choices will be displayed after each round. You can choose the score you would like to play to prior to beginning the game. </p>
    </ul>
